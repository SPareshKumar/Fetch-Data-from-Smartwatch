# Retrieve-Data-from-Smartwatch
Fetches Heart Rate from smartwatches which work on Wear OS, and sends it over a Flask Server to be used by the client.
The application directly fetches real time data directly from sensors, rather than depending on any other third-party application, for increased reliability.

This data can be used to store in a database and then further be used to implement a Real-Time Health Monitoring Website.
